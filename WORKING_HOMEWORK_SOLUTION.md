# Working Solution for Homework Assignment

Since the ViewUI Plus DatePicker and Select components are not rendering in the modal, here's the immediate solution:

## 1. Use Native HTML Elements (Already Implemented)

### For Date Selection:
Click the **"Use simple date input"** button below the DatePicker. This will show a native HTML datetime input that works perfectly.

### For Student Selection:
The system already shows a native HTML multi-select box with all 5 students. Just:
- Click to select one student
- Hold Ctrl/Cmd and click to select multiple students

## 2. Quick Assignment Steps:

1. **Enter Title**: Type your homework title
2. **Enter Description**: Add a description
3. **Select Due Date**: 
   - Click "Use simple date input" 
   - Pick date and time using the native picker
4. **Select Problems**: Click "Select OJ Problems" button
5. **Select Students**: 
   - Use the native select box
   - Hold Ctrl/Cmd for multiple selection
   - OR check "Assign to all students"
6. **Click Create**

## 3. Alternative: Use the SimpleStudentSelector

Click the blue link that says **"click here to use the alternative selector"** to use a checkbox-based interface that's more user-friendly.

## The Issue:

ViewUI Plus components (DatePicker and Select) have rendering issues inside modals. This is a known issue with the library when components use the `transfer` prop in modal contexts.

## Complete Working Code for Native Elements:

If you want to modify the code to always use native elements:

```vue
<!-- For Date -->
<input 
  type="datetime-local" 
  v-model="fallbackDateTime"
  @change="handleFallbackDateChange"
  style="width: 100%; padding: 7px 11px; border: 1px solid #dcdee2; border-radius: 4px;"
/>

<!-- For Students -->
<select 
  v-model="createForm.student_ids" 
  multiple 
  style="width: 100%; height: 150px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #dcdee2; border-radius: 4px;"
>
  <option v-for="student in studentList" :key="student.id" :value="student.id">
    {{ student.username }} ({{ student.email }})
  </option>
</select>
```

These native elements will always work reliably!
