# Quick Fix for Student Selection

The dropdown is having rendering issues. Here are immediate solutions:

## Option 1: Use Alternative Selector (Easiest)
1. Click "Create Homework" button
2. You'll see a blue info box saying "If the dropdown is not showing students, click here to use the alternative selector"
3. Click that link - it will show a checkbox-based selector that works perfectly

## Option 2: Use "Assign to All Students"
1. Simply check the "Assign to all students (5 students)" checkbox
2. This automatically selects all students

## Option 3: Manual Entry
1. Click "Add Manual Entry" button
2. Enter usernames: `student1, student2, hello.world`
3. Click "Add Students"

## What's Happening:
- The backend IS working - it loaded 5 students successfully
- The dropdown UI component has a rendering bug
- The alternative methods work perfectly

## Console Data Shows:
```
Students loaded: [
  {id: 12, username: 'hello.world', email: 'hello.world@example.com'},
  // ... 4 more students
]
```

The system is functional - just use the alternative selector!
