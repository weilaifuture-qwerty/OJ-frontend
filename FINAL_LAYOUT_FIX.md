# Final Layout Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Component Registration Error
- **Problem**: Row and Col components were removed from imports but still registered
- **Fix**: Removed Row and Col from component registration in AdminHomeworkList and StudentHomeworkDetail

### 2. Table Slot Syntax
- **Problem**: Using Vue 3 slot syntax with ViewUI Plus (which uses Vue 2.7 syntax)
- **Fix**: Changed from `#slotName="{ row }"` to `slot="slotName" slot-scope="{ row }"`

### 3. Layout Alignment
- **Problem**: Content was right-aligned or misaligned
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Set content-app container to max-width: 1400px with auto margins
  - Ensured 100% width for main containers
  - Fixed table wrapper to prevent overflow
  - Adjusted column widths (e.g., "Assigned To" column from 120px to minWidth: 200px)

### 4. CSS Structure
- **Simplified approach**: Removed overly aggressive CSS overrides
- **Minimal fixes**: Only fixing what's actually broken
- **Key files**:
  - `layout-alignment-fix.less` - Minimal alignment fixes
  - `common.less` - Table cell padding and overflow fixes
  - Component-specific styles for proper container widths

## Current State
- Admin homework list should display properly with centered layout
- Tables should show all content without overflow
- Page width is limited to 1400px for better readability
- Responsive behavior maintained for smaller screens
